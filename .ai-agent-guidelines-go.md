# AI Agent Development Guidelines (Golang â€“ Scientific TDD)

## ðŸ§  Context
This codebase uses **Golang** and expects all contributions to follow a **Test-Driven Development** (TDD) methodology with scientific rigor. All work must be:
- Iterative and incremental.
- Validated by tests: unit, benchmark, fuzz, and end-to-end.
- Documented with high-quality package and function-level documentation.

---

## ðŸ”¬ Scientific Development Flow

### 1. Hypothesize Before Coding
- Clearly state the **intent** of the step.
- Break down the objective into the **smallest testable unit**.

### 2. Write a Unit Test First
- Use `*_test.go` files for each package.
- Create granular tests that:
  - Validate one responsibility at a time.
  - Include edge cases and invalid inputs.
- Prefer table-driven tests where appropriate: it's often appropriate (focused tests with only a small parameterised function under test is super easy to read and write).
- Use subtests (`t.Run(...)`) to group related scenarios.

### 3. Implement Just Enough Code
- Write the **simplest implementation** to pass the current test.
- Avoid speculative generalisation or feature creep.

### 4. Benchmark Critical Logic
- Create benchmark tests using the `testing.B` type.
- Compare performance for various input sizes, using realistic data if possible.

### 5. Add Fuzz Tests Where Applicable
- Use Goâ€™s native fuzzing (`go test -fuzz=.`) for functions that handle strings, I/O, parsing, or user input.
- Ensure fuzz tests include a seed corpus with edge cases and known tricky inputs.

### 6. Write End-to-End Tests When Needed
- Required when multiple packages interact or when interfaces to external systems exist.
- Place in `internal/e2e/` or similar if appropriate.

### 7. Write Example Tests
- Add `ExampleXXX()` functions for all public-facing methods.
- Use these as **living documentation** for consumers of the API.

## ðŸ“– Documentation Rules

### 8. Document Everything Thatâ€™s Exported
- Every `func`, `type`, `var`, and `const` that starts with an uppercase letter must have a doc comment.
- Comments should:
  - Start with the name of the symbol.
  - Be written in plain, clear English.
  - Explain why it exists, not just what it does.

### 9. Document the Package
- Every `package` must include a `doc.go` with a top-level overview:
  - Purpose
  - Intended usage
  - Public interfaces
  - Known limitations

---

## âœ… Test & Review After Each Step

### 10. Run `go test ./...` on each step
- Check that all tests (unit, example, fuzz, benchmarks) pass.
- Format code (`go fmt ./...`) and lint (`go vet ./...`) automatically after changes.

---

## ðŸ§­ When Unsure
- Ask for clarification or provide multiple safe, testable options.
- Refactor code only when it improves readability or simplifies future steps.

---

## âœ… Summary Flow for Each Contribution

1. Define goal and scope.
2. Write a focused test.
3. Implement code to pass the test.
4. Add example, fuzz, or benchmark as appropriate.
5. Document public APIs and package.
6. Run and verify tests.
7. Plan next step.
